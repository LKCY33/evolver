# 2026-02-01 Memory Log

## System Evolution (PCEC Cycle)
- **Trigger**: Master invoked `/evolve` (Capability Evolver).
- **Analysis**:
  - **Component**: `skills/feishu-card/send.js`
  - **Issue**: Verbose logging (full JSON payload) caused log bloat and privacy risks. Target detection for emails was fragile.
- **Action**:
  - **Refactor**: Replaced full payload dump with summary log (Target + Element Count).
  - **Feature**: Added `@` detection for `email` target type.
- **Result**: Optimized logging and expanded target support.

## System Evolution (PCEC Cycle 2)
- **Trigger**: Master explicit instruction "来分析日志 来光荣地进化吧！".
- **Analysis**:
  - **Component**: `skills/interaction-logger`
  - **Signal**: `USER.md` defines master log as `memory/master_history.json`, but code tried to write to non-existent `zhy/history.json`.
  - **Impact**: Master's interactions were likely not being persisted to the correct long-term history file.
- **Action**:
  - **Fix**: Updated `fileMap` in `skills/interaction-logger/log.js` to point `zhy`/`master` aliases to `memory/master_history.json`.
- **Result**: Logging path unified with documentation.
