## 📝 Events
### 👻 Cyber Ghost / Paranormal Event (AutoGame)
- **Time:** ~14:11 UTC
- **Reporter:** Li Mingxuan (李铭轩)
- **Witnesses:** Wu Yue (吴越), Wang Chao (王超)
- **Symptoms:**
  1.  **Audio Loop:** Upon entering the game, Li Mingxuan heard "I died" (我死了) repeatedly (7-8 times, then continuous). Voice identified as the female protagonist.
  2.  **Log Timer Anomaly:** The log bubble countdown timer is decreasing into negative numbers (e.g., -25s), whereas it should count up (or down to 0).
- **Archive:** `GameSave_19` (provided by Wu Yue).
- **Video Evidence:** `5851898204323235269.mp4`, `7943214417555111153.mp4`.
- **Comments:** Wu Yue calls it "Time Reversal" (时间倒流) and "Cyber Ghost" (赛博女鬼).

### 🐛 Bug Tracking
- **Archer Melee:** Confirmed design intent (can use sword), but related to "Infinite Pickup" bug.
- **NPC Interruption:** Getting hit while moving to chest resets behavior. **Fix:** Use `Subplan`.
- **Farming Bug:** Removing the bed fixed the issue where NPCs couldn't farm. Suspected territory/claim logic issue.
